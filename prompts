Every explicit prompt used in the video, along with its context and the outcome:

UI Design for Live Music Event Discovery App 

Context: The very first step in building the app, using the Relevance UI Designer tool.
Prompt: "I need a UI design for a live music event discovery app."
Outcome: The tool initiated a series of questions to gather design preferences (web/mobile, responsive, brand colors, personality, key screens, UI elements, content, target audience, user flows, inspirational examples).
Requesting UI Changes

Context: After the initial UI design was generated, the user identified a few missing elements and incorrect placements.
Prompt: "It's missing the navbar and also I want the event cards images to be on the left, not the right."
Outcome: The UI Designer tool regenerated the design, incorporating the navbar and moving the event card images to the left, which was "looking much nicer" (49:14).
Initial Bolt.new App Generation 

Context: Pasting the generated image and prompt from the UI Designer into Bolt.new to start building the live app.
Prompt: (Refers to the image and then a text prompt generated by the UI Designer, which was enhanced by Bolt.new's internal tool.) The enhanced prompt detailed elements like a "navbar," "hero banner," "list of event cards," etc., based on the UI design.
Outcome: Bolt.new generated an "amazing first draft" (50:35-50:37) of the application's front end, closely matching the UI design, including an intelligently added filter for event categories (50:51-50:57).
Removing Navbar Links and Search Icon

Context: Refining the automatically generated front end by removing unnecessary elements.
Prompt: "we want to remove the following links from the navbar. We'll take away venues and artists and also remove that search icon."
Outcome: Bolt.new planned to remove the links, but then a "bright red error" (51:38-51:40) appeared, indicating a terminal error.
Fixing Button Hover Styling 

Context: Addressing a UI/UX issue where hovering over an event card made the button dull instead of highlighting it.
Prompt: "I don't like how when I hover over an event card, the button dulls in brightness. What can we do to fix this so that hovering over an event card makes it feel more in focus and not dimmed?"
Outcome: Bolt.new created a plan to fix the styling, and after implementation, hovering over an event card brought it "more into focus" and the "view details button still looks clickable" (54:11-54:20).
Opening Event Details Modal 

Context: Making the "View Details" button functional.
Prompt: "When I click on the view details button, I want to open up a modal for that event that shows all of its details." (Prompt was enhanced.)
Outcome: A modal popped open, displaying the event's details when the "View Details" button was clicked (55:02-55:07).
Removing "Get Tickets" and "Share Event" Buttons from Modal 

Context: Refining the event details modal by removing unwanted buttons.
Prompt: "remove the get tickets and share event buttons from the event modal." (Prompt was enhanced.)
Outcome: The specified buttons were successfully removed from the event modal.
Adding Columns to Superbase Events Table 

Context: Setting up the database by adding necessary fields (columns) for event data.
Prompt: "add the following columns to the existing events table in the connected Superbase project. We want it for title, date, time, location, organizer, description, category, and the image. I'm going to specify here that the image column needs to be prepared for users to eventually upload images and store them within Superbase."
Outcome: Bolt.new created the specified columns in the Superbase events table, ready for data (1:01:00-1:01:07).
Migrating Mock Event Data to Superbase 

Context: Moving static, temporary event data from the app's codebase into the live Superbase database.
Prompt: "I want to remove these mock events from the codebase and migrate them over into the events in my connected Superbase project, mapping all of the properties to their related columns."
Outcome: Bolt.new began the migration process, transferring the mock event data into the Superbase table.
Adding Delete and Edit Buttons to Event Details Modal 

Context: Adding functionality for users to manage their events.
Prompt: "on the event details modal at the bottom left. Add two buttons, a delete and an edit button. They should be nonfunctional for now."
Outcome: "Delete" and "Edit" buttons appeared on the event details modal, but were not yet functional (1:07:15-1:07:22).
Enabling Edit Form Functionality 

Context: Making the "Edit" button functional to allow users to update event details.
Prompt: "when a user clicks the edit button on the event details modal, a new edit event form should appear allowing the user to update any of the fields of that event in the event Superbase table. And we'll ask it to please make sure that it sets up the proper permissions so that a user can patch these event rows from the app." (Prompt was enhanced.)
Outcome: An edit form appeared when the edit button was clicked, allowing for event data modification, and proper row-level security was set up in Superbase.
Enabling Event Deletion 

Context: Making the "Delete" button functional to remove events.
Prompt: "when a user clicks the delete button on the event details modal, I want them to be asked to confirm their deletion and then remove the event from our connected Superbase project." (Prompt was enhanced.)
Outcome: The delete button, when clicked, prompted a confirmation and, upon approval, was intended to remove the event from Superbase. Debugging using the browser console was then necessary to confirm successful deletion.
Creating a Sign-Up Modal 

Context: Implementing user authentication, starting with registration.
Prompt: "create a sign up modal that is opened when the user clicks on the join the movement button."
Outcome: A sign-up modal was created and appeared when the "Join the Movement" button was clicked (1:12:35-1:12:40).
Creating a Sign-In Modal 

Context: Adding a login feature for existing users.
Prompt: "create a sign-in modal in a similar style as the account creation modal that is open when the user clicks on the signin navbar item."
Outcome: Initially, the modal did not open. After reverting to a previous successful state (1:15:10-1:15:12) and re-prompting with slightly different phrasing, the sign-in modal appeared correctly (1:15:42-1:15:46).
Re-prompting for Sign-In Modal 

Context: After encountering an "error loop" with the previous sign-in modal prompt, reverting to a working state and trying a new approach.
Prompt: "Now when the user clicks on the sign-in item in the navbar, open a new modal that takes in the user's email and password and specify that we don't need any actual authentication setup yet."
Outcome: On the first try, the sign-in modal opened correctly (1:15:42-1:15:46).
Switching Between Sign-In and Join Modals 

Context: Enabling users to navigate between the sign-in and sign-up (join) modals.
Prompt: (Screenshot of the modal with the link was provided.) "when I click on this link at the bottom of the sign-in modal, I want to be switched to the join or signup modal we created earlier. And similarly, I want to be shown the sign-in modal when I click on the sign-in link at the bottom of the join modal."
Outcome: The switch from sign-in to join worked immediately, but the switch from join to sign-in required a further prompt (1:16:23-1:16:37).
Fixing Join to Sign-In Modal Switch 

Context: Addressing the issue where the join modal couldn't switch back to the sign-in modal.
Prompt: "On the sign-in modal I can effectively switch to the join modal. But from the join modal I can't yet switch to the sign-in modal from its link at the bottom."
Outcome: The issue was fixed, and users could successfully switch back and forth between the two modals (1:16:42-1:16:48).
Setting Up Superbase Authentication 

Context: Implementing actual user authentication with Superbase.
Prompt: "set up Superbase authentication so that we can create new users by taking in their name, email, and password." (Prompt was enhanced.)
Outcome: Superbase authentication was set up, allowing new users to register with their name, email, and password.
Creating User Profile Page 

Context: Building a personalized profile page for logged-in users.
Prompt: (Screenshot of the planned profile page was provided.) "when a user logs in, they should be routed to a new user profile page. This page should have their user info at the top and two tabs. One for displaying the events they are attending. And we'll specify that we'll build that functionality out later so it doesn't get confused trying to do too many things at the same time. And another one for events the user has created. We'll tell it to refer to the attached image for context." (Prompt was enhanced.)
Outcome: A profile page with user info and two tabs (attending events and created events) was generated, matching the screenshot (1:22:36-1:22:45). However, the full event list was incorrectly displayed on both tabs (1:22:47-1:22:57).
Fixing Profile Page Issues 

Context: Correcting the display of the full event list on the profile page tabs and ensuring users are routed to their profile upon login.
Prompt: "there are a few issues. When the user logs in, they are not routed directly to their profile page. on the profile page, the full event list is being displayed on both the attending and created events tab. Please fix these issues."
Outcome: The issues were resolved, routing users to their profile on login and correctly displaying only relevant events on each tab (1:29:30).
Adding "Join to Attend" Button for Non-Authenticated Users 

Context: Encouraging non-logged-in users to sign up when viewing event details.
Prompt: "on the event details modal for a non-authenticated user, show a join to attend button that pops open the signup modal."
Outcome: If a user is not logged in and opens an event, a "Join to Attend" button appears, which, when clicked, opens the sign-up modal
